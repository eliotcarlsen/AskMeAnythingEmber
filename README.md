# project

This project creates a question and answer message board, similar to Reddit, Quora, StackOverflow or other such sites. Users will be able to submit a question, then other users can respond with answers.

The message board will allow junior developers and newbies learning to code to ask questions that senior developers, product owners, senior designers, recruiters, and other tech professionals can answer.

Questions will include the content of the question itself, an author, and additional notes.
Answers will include the content of the answer and the author.
Project includes a header and/or navbar that appears on all pages. It will contain the name of the site and a link to the home page, and other content such as social media, LinkedIn, etc.
Project lists all questions on the homepage, displaying only the question and the name of the author.

Users can add answers to a question. Answers will be added and viewed on the same page as the question they respond to.
